            available upon request if it applies to you, governs processing relating to our current

            The personal information we collect depends on how you interact with our Services.

            When we use the term “personal information” in this Privacy Policy, we mean all
            information that can be used to identify a natural person, either alone or when
            combined with other information.

            information you provide to us, such as your name, email address, personal website, and
            picture. If you enable phone based two-factor authentication, we collect a phone
            number and you agree to receive text messages from ChatGenius to enable two-factor
            authentication when you login. Message and data rates may apply.

            <p class="py-3 text-base font-semibold leading-7">  Payment Information : </p>  Where we sell products and services through the Services, we
            use third-party applications, such as the Apple App Store, Google Play App Store,
            Amazon App Store, and/or services such as Stripe to process your payments. These
            third-party applications will collect information from you to process a payment on
            behalf of ChatGenius, including your name, email address, mailing address, payment card
            information, and other billing information. ChatGenius does not receive or store your
            payment information, but it may receive and store information associated with your

            card information, and your country of origin).

            <p class="py-3 text-base font-semibold leading-7">  Communication Information: </p>  We collect personal information from you such as email
            address, phone number, mailing address, and marketing preferences when you request

            <p class="py-3 text-base font-semibold leading-7">  Service Use Information: </p> We collect information you provide to the Services for the
            purpose of providing the Services to you, which may include personal information such
