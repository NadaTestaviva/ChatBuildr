                      Summary of our Terms<br />These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are part of the User Agreement– a
                      legally binding contract governing your use of X. You should read these Terms of Service (“Terms”)
                      in full, but here are a few key things you should take away:<br />You will see advertising on the
                      platform: In exchange for accessing the Services, X and our third-party providers and partners may
                      display advertising to you.<br />When posting Content and otherwise using the Services, you must
                      comply with this User Agreement and Applicable Law: You are responsible for your use of the
                      Services and your Content. You must comply with this User Agreement, its incorporated policies,
                      and all applicable laws.<br />You must abide by the Services’ acceptable use terms: You may not
                      access the Services in any way other than through the currently available, published interfaces
                      that we provide. For example, this means that you cannot scrape the Services, try to work around
                      any technical limitations we impose, or otherwise attempt to disrupt the operation of the
                      Services.<br />We have broad enforcement rights: X reserves the right to take enforcement actions
                      against you if you do violate these terms, such as, for example, removing your Content, limiting
                      visibility, discontinuing your access to X, or taking legal action. We may also suspend or
                      terminate your account for other reasons, such as prolonged inactivity, risk of legal exposure, or
                      commercial inviability.<br />There are Intellectual Property Licenses in these Terms: You retain
                      ownership and rights to any of your Content you post or share, and you provide us with a broad,
                      royalty-free license to make your Content available to the rest of the world and to let others do
                      the same. Conversely, we provide you a license to use the software we provide as part of the
                      Services, such as the X mobile application, solely for the purpose of enabling you to use and
                      enjoy the benefit of the Services.<br />Your use of the Services is at your own risk: We provide
                      the Services on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, and we disclaim all warranties,
                      responsibility, and liability to you or others to the extent permitted by law. You may be exposed
                      to offensive or harmful content posted by other users. The Services may change from time to time,
                      and we may limit or terminate availability of the Services or particular features to you or other
                      users at any time.<br />You have remedies and redress mechanisms, but our liability is limited:
                      You have a right to terminate this agreement at any time by deactivating your account and
                      discontinuing use of the Services. Note that we will not be liable for certain types of damages as
                      described in the agreement, and in any event, our aggregate liability shall not exceed the greater
                      of $100 USD or the amount you paid us, if any, in the past six months for the Services giving rise
                      to the claim. Further, if you believe that your Content has been copied in a way that constitutes
                      copyright infringement, the reporting process is detailed in these Terms.
